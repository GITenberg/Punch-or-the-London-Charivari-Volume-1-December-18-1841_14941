<h2>THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON MEDICAL STUDENT.</h2>
<h3>12.&mdash;OF THE COLLEGE, AND THE CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p><span class="hide">O</span>ur hero once more undergoes the
process of grinding before he presents himself in
Lincoln&rsquo;s-inn Fields for examination at the College of
Surgeons. Almost the last affair which our hero troubles himself
about is the Examination at the College of Surgeons; and as his
anatomical knowledge requires a little polishing before he presents
himself in Lincoln&rsquo;s-inn Fields, he once more undergoes the
process of grinding.</p>
<p>The grinder for the College conducts his tuition in the same
style as the grinder for the Hall&mdash;often they are united in
the same individual, who perpetually has a vacancy for a resident
pupil, although his house is already quite full; somewhat
resembling a carpet-bag, which was never yet known to be so crammed
with articles, but you might put something in besides. The class is
carried on similar to the one we have already quoted; but the
knowledge required does not embrace the same multiformity of
subjects; anatomy and surgery being the principal points.</p>
<p>Our old friends are assembled to prepare for their last
examination, in a room fragrant with the amalgamated odours of
stale tobacco-smoke, varnished bones, leaky preparations, and
gin-and-water. Large anatomical prints depend from the walls, and a
few vertebr&aelig;, a lower jaw, and a sphenoid bone, are scattered
upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To return to the eye, gentlemen,&rdquo; says the grinder;
&ldquo;recollect the Petitian Canal surrounds the Cornea. Mr. Rapp,
what am I talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rapp, who is drawing a little man out of dots and lines upon
the margin of his &ldquo;Quain&rsquo;s Anatomy,&rdquo; starts up,
and observes&mdash;&ldquo;Something about the Paddington Canal
running round a corner, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Rapp, you must pay me a little more
attention,&rdquo; expostulates the teacher. &ldquo;What does the
operation for cataract resemble in a familiar point of
view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pushing a boat-hook through the wall of a house to pull
back the drawing-room blinds,&rdquo; answers Mr. Rapp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are incorrigible,&rdquo; says the teacher, smiling at
the simile, which altogether is an apt one. &ldquo;Did you ever see
a case of bad cataract?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, ever-so-long ago&mdash;the Cataract of the
Ganges at Astley&rsquo;s. I went to the gallery, and had a mill
with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, we don&rsquo;t want particulars,&rdquo; interrupts
the grinder; &ldquo;but I would recommend you to mind your eyes,
especially if you get under Guthrie. Mr. Muff, how do you define an
ulcer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The establishment of a raw,&rdquo; replies Mr. Muff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tit! tit! tit!&rdquo; continues the teacher, with an
expression of pity. &ldquo;Mr. Simpson, perhaps you can tell Mr.
Muff what an ulcer is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An abrasion of the cuticle produced by its own
absorption,&rdquo; answers Mr. Simpson, all in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well. I maintain it&rsquo;s easier to say a <em>raw</em>
than all that,&rdquo; observes Mr. Muff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, silence. Mr. Manhug, have you ever been sent for to
a bad incised wound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, when I was an apprentice: a man using a chopper
cut off his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut off myself for the governor, like a two-year
old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now you have no governor, what plan would you pursue
in a similar case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send for the nearest doctor&mdash;call him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, but suppose he wouldn&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call him out, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! you are all quite children,&rdquo; exclaims the
teacher. &ldquo;Mr. Simpson, of what is bone chemically
composed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of earthy matter, or <em>phosphate of lime</em>, and
animal matter, or <em>gelatine</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Mr. Simpson. I suppose you don&rsquo;t know a
great deal a bout bones, Mr. Rapp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, sir. I haven&rsquo;t been a great deal in that
line. They give a penny for three pounds in Clare Market.
That&rsquo;s what I call popular osteology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gelatine enters largely into the animal fibres,&rdquo;
says the leader, gravely. &ldquo;Parchment, or skin, contains an
important quantity, and is used by cheap pastry-cooks to make
jellies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve heard of eating your
<em>words</em>,&rdquo; says Mr. Rapp, &ldquo;but never your
<em>deeds</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo; groan the pupils at this gross
appropriation, and the class getting very unruly is broken up.</p>
<p>The examination at the College is altogether a more respectable
ordeal than the jalap and rhubarb botheration at
Apothecaries&rsquo; Hall, and <em>par cons&eacute;quence</em>, Mr.
Muff goes up one evening with little misgivings as to his success.
After undergoing four different sets of examiners, he is told he
may retire, and is conducted by Mr Belfour into
&ldquo;Paradise,&rdquo; the room appropriated to the fortunate
ones, which the curious stranger may see lighted up every Friday
evening as he passes through Lincoln&rsquo;s-inn Fields. The
inquisitors are altogether a gentlemanly set of men, who are
willing to help a student out of a scrape, rather than &ldquo;catch
question&rdquo; him into one: nay, more than once the candidate has
attributed his success to a whisper prompted by the kind heart of
the venerable and highly-gifted individual&mdash;now, alas! no
more&mdash;who until last year assisted at the examinations.</p>
<p>Of course, the same kind of scene takes place that was enacted
after going up to the Hall, and with the same results, except the
police-office, which they manage to avoid. The next day, as usual,
they are again at the school, standing innumerable pots, telling
incalculable lies, and singing uncounted choruses, until the Scotch
pupil who is still grinding in the museum, is forced to give over
study, after having been squirted at through the keyhole five
distinct times, with a reversed stomach-pump full of beer, and
finally unkennelled. The lecturer upon chemistry, who has a private
pupil in his laboratory learning how to discover arsenic in
poisoned people&rsquo;s stomachs, where there is none, and make
red, blue, and green fires, finds himself locked in, and is obliged
to get out at the window; whilst the professor of medicine, who is
holding forth, as usual, to a select very few, has his lecture upon
intermittent fever so strangely interrupted by distant harmony and
convivial hullaballoo, that he finishes abruptly in a pet, to the
great joy of his class. But Mr. Muff and his friends care not. They
have passed all their troubles&mdash;they are regular medical men,
and for aught they care the whole establishment may blow up, tumble
down, go to blazes, or anything else in a small way that may
completely obliterate it. In another twelve hours they have
departed to their homes, and are only spoken of in the reverence
with which we regard the ruins of a by-gone edifice, as bricks who
were.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Our task is finished. We have traced Mr. Muff from the new man
through the almost entomological stages of his being to his perfect
state; and we take our farewell of him as the &ldquo;general
practitioner.&rdquo; In our Physiology we have endeavoured to show
the medical student as he actually exists&mdash;his reckless
gaiety, his wild frolics, his open disposition. That he is careless
and dissipated we admit, but these attributes end with his
pupilage; did they not do so spontaneously, the up-hill struggles
and hardly-earned income of his laborious future career would, to
use his own terms, &ldquo;soon knock it all out of him;&rdquo;
although, in the after-waste of years, he looks back upon his
student&rsquo;s revelries with an occasional return of old
feelings, not unmixed, however, with a passing reflection upon the
lamentable inefficacy of the present course of medical education
pursued at our schools and hospitals, to fit a man for future
practice.</p>
<p>We have endeavoured in our sketches so to frame them, that the
general reader might not be perplexed by technical or local
allusions, whilst the students of London saw they were the work of
one who had lived amongst them. And if in some places we have
strayed from the strict boundaries of perfect refinement, yet we
trust the delicacy of our most sensitive reader has received no
wound. We have discarded our joke rather than lose our propriety;
and we have been pleased at knowing that in more than one family
circle our Physiology has, now and then, raised a smile on the lips
of the fair girls, whose brothers were following the same path we
have travelled over at the hospitals.</p>
<p>We hope with the new year to have once more the gratification of
meeting our friends. Until then, with a hand offered in warm
fellowship,&mdash;not only to those composing the class he once
belonged to, but to all who have been pleased to bestow a few
minutes weekly upon his chapters,&mdash;the Medical Student takes
his leave.</p>

<h2>THE &ldquo;PUFF PAPERS.&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p>On my next visit I found Mr. Bayles in full force, and loud in
praise of some eleemosynary entertainment to which he had been
invited. Having exhausted his subject and a tumbler of toddy at the
same time, Mr. Arden &ldquo;availed himself of the opportunity to
call attention to the next tale,&rdquo; which was found to be</p>
<h3>A FATAL REMEMBRANCE.</h3>
<p>I was subaltern of the cantonment main-guard at Bangalore one
day in the month of June, 182-. Tattoo had just beaten; and I was
sitting in the guard-room with my friend Frederick Gahagan, the
senior Lieutenant in the regiment to which I belonged, and manager
of the amateur theatre of the station.</p>
<p>Gahagan was a rattling, care-for-nothing Irishman, whose chief
characteristic was a strong propensity for theatricals and
practical jokes, but withal a generous, warm-hearted fellow, and as
gallant a soldier as ever buckled sword-belt. In his capacity of
manager, he was at present in a state of considerable perplexity,
the occasion whereof was this.</p>
<p>There chanced then to be on a visit at Bangalore a particular
ally of Fred&rsquo;s, who was leading tragedian of the Chowringhee
theatre in Calcutta; and it was in contemplation to get up Macbeth,
in order that the aforesaid star might exhibit in his crack part as
the hero of that great tragedy. Fred was to play Macduff; and the
&ldquo;blood-boltered Banquo&rdquo; was consigned to my charge. The
other parts were tolerably well cast, with the exception of that of
Lady Macbeth, which indeed was not cast at all, seeing that no
representative could be found for it. It must be stated that, as we
had no actresses amongst us, all our female characters, as in the
times of the primitive drama, were necessarily performed by
gentlemen. Now in general it was not difficult to command a supply
of smooth-faced young ensigns to personate the heroines,
waiting-maids, and old women, of the comedies and farces to which
our performances had been hitherto restricted. But Lady Macbeth was
a very different sort of person to Caroline Dormer and Mrs.
Hardcastle; and our <em>ladies</em> accordingly, one and all,
struck work, refusing point blank to have anything to say to
her.</p>
<p>The unfortunate manager, who had set his heart upon getting up
the piece, was at his wits&rsquo; end, and had bent his footsteps
towards the main guard, to advise with me as to what should be done
in this untoward emergency. I endeavoured to console him as well as
I could, and suggested, that if the worst came to the worst, the
part might be read. But, lugubriously shaking his caput, Fred
declared that would never do; so, after discussing half-a-dozen
Trichinopoly cheroots, with a proportionate quantum of brandy
<em>pani</em>, he departed for his quarters.
&ldquo;disgusted,&rdquo; as he said, &ldquo;with the ingratitude of
mankind,&rdquo; whilst I set forth to go my grand rounds.</p>
<p>Next morning, having been relieved from guard, I had returned
home, and was taking my ease in my camp chair, luxuriously whiffing
away at my after-breakfast cheroot, when who should step gingerly
into the room but Manager Fred Gahagan. The clouds of the previous
evening had entirely disappeared from his ingenuous countenance,
which was puckered up in the most insinuating manner, with what I
was wont to call his &lsquo;borrowing smile;&rsquo; for Fred was
oftentimes afflicted with impecuniosity&mdash;a complaint common
enough amongst us subs;&mdash;and when the fit was on him, in the
spirit of true friendship, he generally contrived to disburthen me
of the few remaining rupees that constituted the balance of my last
month&rsquo;s pay.</p>
<p>Fred brought himself to an anchor upon a bullock trunk, and,
after my boy had handed him a cheroot, and he had disgorged a few
puffs of smoke, thus delivered himself&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a capital weed, Wilmot. I don&rsquo;t know how it
is, but you always manage to have the best tobacco in the
cantonment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem,&rdquo; said I, drily. &ldquo;Glad you like
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Peter, my dear fellow,&rdquo; quoth he,
&ldquo;Fitzgerald, Grimes, and I, have just been talking over what
we were discussing last night, about Lady Macbeth you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, somewhat relieved to find the
conversation was not taking the turn I dreaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; continued Fred, plunging at once
&ldquo;in medias res,&rdquo;and speaking very fast, &ldquo;and we
have come to the conclusion that you are the only person to relieve
us from all difficulty on the subject; Fitzgerald will take your
part of Banquo; and you shall have Lady Macbeth, a character for
which every one agrees you are admirably fitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I play Lady Macbeth!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;with my
scrubbing-brush of a beard, and whiskers like a prickly-pear hedge;
why, you mast be all mad to think of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; remarked Gahagan mildly,
&ldquo;you know I have always said that you had the Kemble eye and
nose, and I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t hesitate about cutting off
your whiskers when so much depends upon it; they&rsquo;ll soon grow
again you know, Peter; as for your dark chin that don&rsquo;t
matter a rush, as Lady Macbeth is a dark woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reader will agree with me in thinking that friendship can
sometimes be as blind as love, when I say with respect to my
&ldquo;Kemble eye and nose,&rdquo; that the former has been from
childhood affected with a decided tendency to strabismus, and the
latter bears a considerably stronger resemblance to a pump-handle
than it does to the classic profile of John Kemble or any of his
family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Gahagan,&rdquo; said I, solemnly, &ldquo;do
you remember how, some six years ago at Hydrabad, when yet
beardless and whiskerless, the only hair upon my face being
eyebrows and eyelashes, at your instigation and &lsquo;suadente
diabolo,&rsquo; I attempted to perform Lydia Languish in &lsquo;The
Rivals?&rsquo; and hast thou yet forgotten, O son of an unsainted
father, how my grenadier stride, the fixed tea-pot position of my
arms, to say nothing of the numerous other solecisms in the code of
female manners which I perpetrated on that occasion, made me a
laughing-stock and a by-word for many a long day afterwards! All
this, I say, must be fresh in your recollection, and yet you have
the audacity to ask me to expose myself again in a similar
manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh, pooh!&rdquo; laughed Gahagan, &ldquo;you were only
a boy then, now you have more experience in these matters; besides,
Lydia Languish was a part quite unworthy of your powers; Lady
Macbeth is a horse of another colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, man, with what face could I aver that</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">&lsquo;I have given suck, and know</p>
<p>How tender &rsquo;tis to love the babe that milks me.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That would certainly draw tears from the audience, but they
would be tears of laughter, not sympathy, I warrant you. No, no,
good master Fred, it won&rsquo;t do, I tell you; and in the words
of Lady Macbeth herself, I say&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">&lsquo;What beast was&rsquo;t, then,</p>
<p>That made you break this enterprise to me?&rsquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And now oblige me by walking your body off, for I have got my
yesterday&rsquo;s guard report to fill up and send in, in default
of which I shall be sure to catch an &lsquo;official&rsquo; from
the Brigade-Major.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Fred not only did not walk his body off, but harping on the
same string, pertinaciously continued to ply me with alternate
arguments and intreaties, until at last fairly wearied out, and
more, I believe, with the hope of getting rid of the
&ldquo;importunate chink&rdquo; of the fellow&rsquo;s discourse,
than anything else, in an evil moment I consented! hear it not,
shade of Mrs. Siddons! to denude myself of the bushy honours of my
cheeks, and tread the boards of the Bangalore stage as the wife of
that atrocious usurper &ldquo;King Cawdor Glamis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred marched himself away, elated at having carried his point;
and I, after sundry dubious misgivings anent the rash promise I had
made, ended by casting all compunctious visitings to the winds, and
doughtily resolved, as I was in for the business, to &ldquo;screw
my courage to the sticking-place,&rsquo; and go through with it as
boldly as I might.</p>
<p>By dint of continually studying my r&ocirc;le, my dislike to it
gradually diminished, nay, at length was converted into positive
enthusiasm. I became convinced that I should make a decided hit,
and cover my temples with unfading laurel. I rehearsed at all
times, seasons, and places, until I was a perfect nuisance to
everybody, and my acquaintance, I am sure, to a man, wished both me
and her bloodthirsty ladyship, deeper than plummet ever sounded, at
the bottom of the sea. Even the brute creation did not escape the
annoyance. One morning my English pointer &ldquo;Spot&rdquo; ran
yelping out of the room, panic-stricken by the vehement manner with
which I exclaimed, &ldquo;Out damned <em>spot</em>, out, I
say!&rdquo; and with the full conviction, which the animal probably
entertained to the day of his death, that the said anathema had
personal reference to himself.</p>
<p>The evening big with my fate at last arrived. The house was
crammed, expectation on tiptoe, and the play commenced. The first
four acts went off swimmingly, my performance especially was
applauded to the echo, and there only wanted the celebrated
sleeping scene, in which I flattered myself to be particularly
strong, to complete my triumph. Triumph, did I say!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>[pg
267]</span>
<p>I must here explain, for the benefit of those who have never
rounded the Cape, that the extreme heat of an Indian climate is so
favourable to the growth of hair as to put those wights who are
afflicted with dark <em>chevelures</em>, which was my case, to the
inconvenient necessity of chin-scraping twice on the game day, when
they wish to appear particularly spruce of an evening. Now I
intended to have shaved before the play began, but in the hurry of
dressing had forgotten all about it; and upon inspecting my visage
in a glass, after I had donned Lady Macbeth&rsquo;s night-gear, the
lower part of it appeared so swart in contrast with the white
dress, that I found it would be absolutely necessary to pass a
razor over it before going on with my part.</p>
<p>The night was excessively warm, even for India; and as the place
allotted to us for dressing was very small and confined, the bright
thought struck me that I should have more air and room on the
stage, whither I accordingly directed my servant to follow me with
the shaving apparatus.</p>
<p>I ensconced myself behind the drop-scene, which was down, and
was in the act of commencing the tonsorial operation, when,
<em>horresco referens</em>, the prompter&rsquo;s bell rang sharply,
whether by accident or design I was never able to ascertain, but
have grievous suspicions that Fred Gahagan knew something about
it&mdash;up flew the drop-scene like a shot, and discovered the
following <em>tableau vivant</em> to the astounded
audience:&mdash;</p>
<p>Myself Lady Macbeth, with legs nearly a yard asunder&mdash;face
and throat outstretched, and covered with a plentiful white
lather&mdash;right arm brandishing aloft one of Paget&rsquo;s best
razors, and left thumb and forefinger grasping my nose. In front of
me stood my faithful Hindoo valet, Verasawmy by name, with a
soap-box in one hand, while his other held up to his master&rsquo;s
gaze a small looking-glass, over the top of which his black face,
surmounted by a red turban, was peering at me with grave and
earnest attention.</p>
<p>A wondering pause of a few seconds prevailed, and then one loud,
rending, and continuous peal of laughter and screams shook the
universal house.</p>
<p>As if smitten with sudden catalepsy, I was without power to move
a single muscle of my body, and for the space of two minutes
remained in a stupor in the same attitude&mdash;immovable, rooted,
frozen to the spot where I stood. At length recovering at once my
senses and power of motion, I bounded like a maniac from the stage,
pursued by the convulsive roars of the spectators, and upsetting in
my retreat the unlucky Verasawmy, who rolled down to the
footlights, doubled up, and in a paroxysm of terror and dismay.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Frederick Gahagan had good reason to bless his stars
that in that moment of frenzy I did not encounter him, the
detestable origin of the abomination that had just been heaped upon
my head. I am no two-legged creature if I should not have
sacrificed him on the spot with my razor, and so merited the
gratitude of his regimental juniors by giving them a step.</p>
<p>I have never since, either in public or private life, appeared

<h3>STARVATION STATISTICS FOR SIR ROBERT PEEL</h3>
<p>That the people of this country are grossly pampered there can
be no doubt, for the following facts have been ascertained from
which it will be seen that there have been instances of persons
living on much coarser fare than the working classes in
England.</p>
<p>In 1804, a shipwrecked mariner, who was thrown on to the
celebrated mud-island of Coromandel, lived for three weeks upon his
own wearing apparel. He first sucked all the goodness out of his
jacket, and the following day dashed his buttons violently against
the rock in order to soften them. He next cut pieces from his
trousers, as tailors do when they want cabbage, and found them an
excellent substitute for that salubrious vegetable. He was in the
act of munching his boots for breakfast one morning, when he was
fortunately picked up by his Majesty&rsquo;s schooner
<em>Cutaway</em>.</p>
<p>In the year &rsquo;95, the crew of the brig <em>Terrible</em>
lost all their provisions, except a quantity of candles. After
these were gone, they took a plank out of the side of the vessel
and sliced it, which was their board for a whole fortnight.</p>
<p>After these startling and particularly well-authenticated facts,
it would be absurd to deny that there is no reason for taking into
consideration the comparatively trifling distress that is now
prevalent.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE FASTEST MAN.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;A person named Meara,&rdquo; says the <em>Galway
Advertiser</em>, &ldquo;confined for debt some time since in our
town jail, fasted sixteen days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sibthorp says this is an excellent illustration of hard and
fast, and entitles the gentleman to be placed at</p>

<h3>THE COPPER CAPTAIN.</h3>
<p>At the public meeting at Hammersmith for the purpose of taking
into consideration the propriety of lighting the roads, in the
midst of a most animated discussion, Captain Atcherly proposed an
adjournment of the said meeting; which proposition being strongly
negatived by a small individual, Captain Atcherly quietly pointed
to an open window, made a slight allusion to the hardness of the
pavement, and finally achieved the exit of the dissentient by
whistling</p>

<h2>&ldquo;TAKE CARE OF HIM.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of him!&rdquo; That sentence has been my ruin;
from my cradle upwards it has dogged my steps and proved my bane!
Fatal injunction! Little did my parents think of the miseries those
four small monosyllables have entailed upon their hapless son!</p>
<p>My first assertion of infantine existence, that innocent and
feeble wail that claimed the name of life, was met by the command,
&ldquo;Take care of him! take care of him!&rdquo; said my mother to
the doctor; &ldquo;Take care of him!&rdquo; said the doctor to the
nurse; and &ldquo;Take care of him!&rdquo; added my delighted
father to every individual of the rejoicing household.</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s care manifested itself in an over-dose of
castor oil; the nurse, in the plenitude of her bounty, nearly
parboiled me in an over-heated bath; my mother drugged me with a
villanous decoction of soothing syrup, which brought on a slumber
so sound that the first had very nearly proved my last; and the
entire household dandled me with such uncommon vigour that I was
literally tossed and &ldquo;Catchee-catchee&rsquo;d&rdquo; into a
fit of most violent convulsions. As I persisted in surviving, so
did I become the heir to fresh torments from the ceaseless care of
those by whom I was surrounded. My future symmetry was superinduced
by bandaging my infant limbs until I looked like a miniature mummy.
The summer&rsquo;s sun was too hot and the winter&rsquo;s blast too
cold; wet was death, and dry weather was attended with easterly
winds. I was &ldquo;taken care of.&rdquo; I never breathed the
fresh air of Heaven, but lived in an artificial nursery atmosphere
of sea-coal and logs.</p>
<p>Young limbs are soon broken, and young children will fall, if
not taken care of; consequently upon any instinctive attempt at a
pedestrian performance I was tied round the middle with a broad
ribbon, my unhappy little feet see-sawing in the air, and barely
brushing the ruffled surface of the Persian carpet, while I
appeared like a tempting bait, with which my nurse, after the
manner of an experienced angler, was bobbing for some of the
strange monsters worked into the gorgeous pattern.</p>
<p>Crooked legs were &ldquo;taken care of&rdquo; by a brace of
symmetrical iron shackles, and Brobdignag walnut-shells, decorated
with flaming bows of crimson ribbon, were attached to each side of
my small face, to prevent me from squinting. When old enough to
mount a pony, I was &ldquo;taken such care of,&rdquo; by being
secured to the saddle, that the restive little brute, feeling
inclined for a tumble, deliberately rolled over me some half-dozen
times before the astonished stable-boy could effect my deliverance!
while the corks with which I was provided to learn to swim in some
three feet square of water, slipped accidentally down to my toes,
and left me submerged so long that the total consumption of all the
salt, and wetting in boiling water of all the blankets, in the
house was found absolutely necessary to effect my
resuscitation.</p>
<p>At school I was once more to be &ldquo;taken care of;&rdquo;
consequently I pined to death in a wretched single-bedded room,
shuddering with inconceivable horror at the slightest sound, and
conjuring up legions of imaginary sprites to haunt my couch during
my waking hours of dread and misery. O how I envied the reckless
laughter of the gleeful urchins whose unmindful parents left them
to the happy utterance of their own and participation in their
young companions&rsquo; thoughts!</p>
<p>As a parlour boarder, which I was of course, &ldquo;to be taken
care of,&rdquo; I was not looked upon as one of the
&ldquo;fellows,&rdquo; but merely as a little upstart&mdash;one who
most likely was pumped by the master and mistress, and peached upon
the healthy rebels of the little world.</p>
<p>Christmas brought me no joys. &ldquo;Taking care of my
health&rdquo; prevented me from skating and snow-balling; while
perspective surfeits deprived me of the enjoyments of the turkeys,
beef, and glorious pudding.</p>
<p>At eighteen I entered as a gentleman commoner at &mdash;&mdash;
College, Cambridge; and at nineteen a suit of solemn black, and the
possession of five thousand a year, bespoke me heir to all my
father left; and from that hour have I had cause to curse the title
of this paper. Young and inexperienced, I entered wildly into all
the follies wealth can purchase or fashion justify; but I was still
to be the victim of the phrase. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take care of
him,&rdquo; said a knot of the most determined play-men upon town;
and they did. Two years saw my five thousand per annum reduced to
one, but left me with somewhat more knowledge of the world. Even
that was turned against me; and prudent fathers shook their heads,
and sagely cautioned their own young scapegraces &ldquo;to take
care of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All was not yet complete. A walk down Bond Street was
interrupted by a sudden cry, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s him&mdash;take
care of him!&rdquo; I turned by instinct, and was arrested at the
suit of a scoundrel whose fortune I had made, and who in gratitude
had thus pointed me out to the myrmidon of the Middlesex sheriff. I
was located in a lock-up house, and thence conveyed to jail. In
both instances the last words I heard in reference to myself were
&ldquo;Take care of him.&rdquo; I sacrificed almost my all, and
once more regained my liberty. Fate seemed to turn! A friend lent
me fifty pounds. I pledged my honour for its repayment. He promised
to use his interest for my future welfare. I kept my word
gratefully; returned the money on the day appointed. I did so
before one who knew me by report only, and looked upon me as a
ruined, dissipated, worthless Extravagant. I returned to an
adjoining room to wait my friend&rsquo;s coming. While there, I
could not avoid hearing the following colloquy&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heaven! has that fellow actually returned your
fifty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Didn&rsquo;t you see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I did; but I can scarcely believe my eyes. Oh!
he&rsquo;s a deep one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a most honourable young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you be so green? He has a motive in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What motive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. But, old fellow, listen to me.
I&rsquo;m a man of the world, and have seen something of life; and
I&rsquo;ll stake my honour and experience that that fellow means to
do you; so be advised, and&mdash;&lsquo;Take care of
him!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much. I rushed out almost mad, and demanded an
apology, or satisfaction&mdash;the latter alternative was chosen.
Oh, how my blood boiled! I should either fall, or, at length, by
thus chastising the impertinent, put an end to the many meaning and
hateful words.</p>
<p>We met; the ground was measured. I thought for a moment of the
sin of shedding human blood, and compressed my lips. A moment I
wavered; but the voice of my opponent&rsquo;s second whispering,
&ldquo;Take care of him,&rdquo; once more nerved my heart and arm.
My adversary&rsquo;s bullet whistled past my ear: <em>he</em>
fell&mdash;hit through the shoulder. He was carried to his
carriage. I left the ground, glad that I had chastised him, but
released to find the wound was not mortal. I felt as if in Heaven
this act would free me from the worldly ban. A week after, I met
one of my old friends; he introduced me by name to his father. The
old gentleman started for a moment, then exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;You
know my feeling, Sir&mdash;you are a duellist! Tom, &lsquo;Take
care of him!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE SCHOOL OF DESIGN AT HOOKAM-CUM-SNIVERY.</h2>
<p>Wednesday last was the day fixed for the distribution of the
prizes at this institution, and every arrangement had been made to
receive the numerous visitors. The boards had undergone their
annual scrubbing, and some beautiful devices in chalk added life to
the floor, which was enriched with a scroll-work of whiting, while
the arms of Hookham-cum-Snivery (a nose, <em>rampant</em>, with a
hand, <em>couchant</em>, extending a thumb, <em>gules</em>, to the
nostril, <em>argent</em>) formed an appropriate centre-piece.</p>
<p>Seven o&rsquo;clock was fixed upon for the opening of the doors,
at which hour the committee went in procession, headed by their
chairman, to withdraw the bolts, that the public might be admitted,
when a rush took place of the most frightful and disastrous
character. A drove of bullocks that were being alternately enticed
and marling-spiked into a butcher&rsquo;s exactly opposite, took
advantage of the courtesy of the committee, and poured in with
great rapidity to the building, carrying everything&mdash;including
the committee&mdash;most triumphantly before them. In spite of
their unceremonious entry, some of the animals evinced a
disposition to stand upon forms, by leaping on to the benches,
while the committee, who had expected a deputation of
<em>savans</em> from the Hampton-<em>super</em>-Horsepond
Institution, for the enlightenment of ignorant octagenarians, and
who being prepared to see a party of donkeys, were not inclined to
take the bull by the horns, made a precipitate retreat into the
anteroom.</p>
<p>Order having been at length restored, the intruders ejected, and
their places supplied by a select circle of subscribers, the
following prizes were distributed:&mdash;</p>
<p>To Horatio Smith Smith, the large copper medal, bearing on one
side the portrait of George the Third, on the reverse a figure of
Britannia, sitting on a beer barrel, and holding in her hand a
toasting fork. This medal was given for the best drawing of the
cork of a ginger-beer bottle.</p>
<p>To Ferdinand Fitz-Figgins, the smaller copper medal, with the
head of William the Fourth, and a reverse similar to that of the
superior prize. This was awarded for the best drawing of a decayed
tooth after <em>Teniers</em>.</p>
<p>To Sigismond Septimus Snobb, the large willow pattern plate, for
the best model of a national water-butt, to be erected in the
Teetotalers&rsquo; Hall of Temperance in the <em>Water</em>-loo
Road.</p>
<p>To Lucius Junius Brutus Brown, the Marsh-gate turnpike ticket
for Christmas-day&mdash;of which an early copy has been most
handsomely presented by the contractor. This useful and interesting
document has been given for the best design&mdash;upon the river
Thames, with the view to igniting it.</p>
<p>The proceedings having been terminated, so far as the
distribution was concerned, the following speeches were
delivered:&mdash;</p>
<p>The first orator was Mr. Julius Jones, who spoke nearly as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Mither Prethident and thubtheriberth of the Hookam-cum-Sthnivey
Sthchool of Dethign, in rithing to addreth thuch an afthembly ath
thith&mdash;</p>
<p>Here the confusion became so general that our reporter could
catch nothing further, and as the partisans of Mr. Jones became
very much excited, while the opposition was equally violent, our
reporter fearing that, though he could not catch the speeches, he
might possibly catch something else, effected his retreat as
speedily as possible.</p>
<hr />
<h3>QUEER QUERIES.</h3>
<h4>NOT THE BEST IN THE WORLD.</h4>
<p>Why is a man with his eyes shut like an illiterate
schoolmaster?&mdash;Because he keeps his pupils in darkness.</p>
<h4>BETTER NEXT TIME.</h4>
<p>Why is the present Lord Chancellor wickeder than the
last?&mdash;Because he&rsquo;s got two more Vices.</p>
<h4>FORGIVE US THIS ONCE.</h4>
<p>Why are abbots the greatest dunces in the world?&mdash;Because
they never get further than their <em>Abbacy</em> (A, B, C.)</p>
<h4>WE&rsquo;LL NEVER DO SO ANY MORE.</h4>
<p>Why is an auctioneer like a man with an ugly
countenance?&mdash;Because he is always for-<em>bidding</em>.</p>
<h4>WE REALLY COULD NOT HELP IT.</h4>
<p>Why is Mrs. Lilly showing the young Princes like an affected
ladies&rsquo;-maid?&mdash;Because she exhibits her mistress&rsquo;s
heirs (airs).</p>
<hr />
<h3>IMPORTANT INTELLIGENCE.</h3>
<p>A dispatch, bearing a foreign post-mark, was handed very
generally about in the city this morning, but its contents did not
transpire. Considerable speculation is afloat on the subject, but
we are unable to give any particulars.</p>
<p>Downing-street was in a state of great activity all yesterday,
and people were passing to and fro repeatedly. This excitement is
generally believed to be connected with nothing particular. We have
our own impression on the subject, but as disclosures would be
premature, we purposely forbear making any. We can only say, at
present, that Sir Robert Peel continues to hold the office of Prime
Minister.</p>

<h2>THE &ldquo;WEIGHT&rdquo; OF ROYALTY.&mdash;THE SOCIAL
&ldquo;SCALE.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Prince of Wales it is allowed upon all hands is the finest
baby ever sent into this naughty world since the firstborn of Eve.
At a day old he would make three of any of the new-born babes that
a month since blessed the Union bf Sevenoaks. There is, however, a
remarkable providence in this. The Prince of Wales is born to the
vastness of a palace; the little Princes of Pauperdom being doomed
to lie at the rate of fifteen in &ldquo;two beds tied
together,&rdquo; are happily formed of corresponding dimensions,
manufactured of more &ldquo;squeezeable materials.&rdquo; There is,
be sure of it, a providence watching over parish unions as well as
palaces. How, for instance, would boards of guardians pack their
new-born charges, if every babe of a union had the brawn and bone
of a Prince of Wales?</p>
<p>However, we could wish that the little Prince was thrice his
size&mdash;an aspiration in which our readers will heartily join,
when they learn the goodly tidings we are about to tell them.</p>
<p>We believe it is not generally known that Sir PETER LAURIE is as
profound an orientalist as perhaps any Rabbi dwelling in
Whitechapel. Sir PETER, whilst recently searching the Mansion House
library,&mdash;which has been greatly enriched by eastern
manuscripts, the presents of the late Sir WILLIAM CURTIS, Sir
CLAUDIUS HUNTER, and the venerable Turk who is Wont to sell rhubarb
in Cheapside, and supplied dinner-pills to the Court of
Aldermen,&mdash;Sir PETER, be it understood, lighted upon a rare
work on the Mogul Country, in which it is stated that on every
birth-day of the Great Mogul, his Magnificence is duly weighed in
scales against so much gold and silver&mdash;his precise weight in
the precious metals being expended on provisions for the poor.</p>
<p>Was there ever a happier device to make a nation interested in
the greatness of their sovereign? The fatter the king, the fuller
his people! With this custom naturalised among us, what a blessing
would have been the corpulency of GEORGE THE FOURTH! How the royal
haunches, the royal abdomen, would have had the loyal aspirations
of the poor and hungry! The national anthem would have had an
additional verse in thanksgiving for royal flesh; and in our
orisons said in churches, we should not only have prayed for the
increasing years of our &ldquo;most religious King,&rdquo; but for
his increasing fat!</p>
<p>It is however useless to regret forgotten advantages; let us, on
the contrary, with new alacrity, avail ourselves of a present
good.</p>
<p>Our illumination on the christening of the Prince of
Wales&mdash;we at once, and in the most liberal manner, give the
child his title&mdash;has been generally scouted, save and except
by a few public-spirited oil and tallow-merchants. It has been
thought better to give away legs of mutton on the occasion, than to
waste any of the sheep in candles. This proposition&mdash;it is
known&mdash;has our heartiest concurrence. Here, however, comes in
the wisdom of our dear Sir Peter. He, taking the hint from the
Mogul Country, proposes that the Prince of Wales should be weighed
in scales&mdash;weighed, naked as he was born, without the purple
velvet and ermine robe in which his Highness is ordinarily shown
in, not that Sir PETER would sink <em>that</em> &ldquo;as
offal&rdquo;&mdash;against his royal weight in beef and pudding;
the said beef and pudding to be distributed to every poor family
(if the family count a certain number of mouths, his Royal Highness
to be weighed twice or thrice, as it may be) to celebrate the day
on which his Royal Highness shall enter the pale of the Christian
Church.</p>
<p>We have all heard what a remarkably fine child his Royal
Babyhood is; but would not this distribution of beef and pudding
convince the country of the fact? How folks would rejoice at the
chubbiness of the Prince, when they saw a evidence of his bare
dimensions smoking on their table! How their hearts would leap up
at his fat, when they beheld it typified upon their platters! How
they would be gladdened by prize royalty, while their mouths
watered at prize beef! And how, with all their admiration of the
exceeding lustihood of the Prince of Wales,&mdash;how, from the
very depths of their stomachs, would they wish His Royal Highness
twice as big!</p>
<p>Is not this a way to disarm Chartism of its sword and pike,
making even O&rsquo;CONNOR, VINCENT, and PINKETHLIE, throw away
their weapons for a knife and fork? Is not this the way to make the
weight of royalty easy&mdash;oh, most easy!&mdash;to a burthened
people? The beef-and-pudding representatives of His Royal Highness,
preaching upon every poor man&rsquo;s table, would carry the
consolations of loyalty to every poor man&rsquo;s stomach. When the
children of the needy lisped &ldquo;plum pudding,&rdquo; would they
not think of the Prince?</p>
<p>(Now, then, our readers know the obligation of the country to
Sir PETER LAURIE&mdash;an obligation which we are happy to state
will be duly acknowledged by the Common Council, that grateful body
having already petitioned the Government for the waste leaden pipes
preserved from the fire at the Tower, that a statue of Sir Peter
may be cast from the metal, and placed in some convenient nook of
the Mansion-House, where the Lord Mayor for the time being may, it
is hoped, behold it at least once a-day.)</p>
<p>This happy suggestion of Sir PETER&rsquo;S may, however, be
followed up with the best national effect. Christmas is fast
Approaching: let the fashion set by the Prince of Wales be followed
by all public bodies&mdash;by all individuals &ldquo;blessed with
aught to give.&rdquo; Let the physical weight of all
corporations&mdash;all private benefactors of the poor, be
distributed in eatables to the indigent and famishing. When the
Alderman, with &ldquo;three fingers on the ribs&rdquo; gives his
weight in geese or turkeys to the poor of his ward, he returns the
most pertinent thanks-giving to providence, that has put money in
his pocket and flesh upon his bones. The poor may have an
unexpected cause to bless the venison and turtle that have fattened
his bowels, seeing that they are made the depositories of their
weight.</p>
<p>This standard of Christmas benefactions may admit of very
curious illustration. For instance, we would not tie the noble and
the aristocratic to any particular kind of viands, but would allow
them to illustrate their self-value of the &ldquo;porcelain of all
human clay&rdquo; by the richness and rarity of their
subscriptions. Whilst a SIBTHORP, with a fine sense of humility,
might be permitted to give his weight in calves&rsquo; or
sheeps&rsquo; heads (be it understood we must have the
<em>whole</em> weight of the Colonel, for if we were to sink
<em>his</em> offal, what in the name of veal would remain?), a Duke
of WELLINGTON should be allowed to weight against nothing less than
the fattest venison and the finest turtle. As the Duke, too, is
<em>rather</em> a light weight, we should be glad if he would
condescend to take a Paisley weaver or two in the scale with him,
to make his subscription of eatables the more worthy of acceptance.
All the members of the present Cabinet would of course be weighed
against loaves and fishes (on the present occasion we would accept
nothing under the very finest wheaten bread and the very best of
turbot), whilst a LAURIE, who has worked such a reform in
cut-throats, should be weighed out to his ward in the most select
stickings of beef.</p>
<p>All we propose to ourselves in these our weekly essays is, to
give brief suggestions for the better government of the world, and
for the bringing about the millennium, which&mdash;when we are
given away <em>gratis</em> in the streets&mdash;may be considered
to have arrived. Hence, we cannot follow put through all its
natural ramifications the benevolent proposition here laid down. We
trust, however, we have done enough. It is not necessary that we
should particularise all public men, tying them to be weighed
against specific viands: no, our readers will at once recognise the
existence of the parties, and at once acknowledge their fittest
offerings. It may happen that a peer might very properly be weighed
against shin of beef, and a Christian bishop be popped in the scale
against a sack of perriwinkles; it remains, however, with
LONDONDERRY or EXETER to be weighed if they will against golden
pheasants and birds of paradise.</p>
<p>We are perfectly aware that if many of the elect of the land
were to weigh themselves against merely the things they are worth,
that a great deal of the food subscribed would be unfit to be eaten
even by the poor. We should have rats, dogs, snakes, bats, and all
other unclean animals; but in levying the parties to weigh
themselves at their own valuation, the poor may be certain to
&ldquo;sup in the Apollo.&rdquo; On this principle we should have
the weight of a LYNDHURST served to this neighbourhood in the
tenderest house-lamb, and a STANLEY kicking the beam against so
many &ldquo;sucking doves.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>FASHIONS FOR THE MONTH.</h3>
<p>Coats are very much worn, particularly at the elbows, and are
trimmed with a shining substance, which gives them a very glossy
appearance. A rim of white runs down the seams, and the covering of
the buttons is slightly opened, so as to show the wooden material
under it.</p>
<p>Hats are now slightly indented at the top, and we have seen
several in which part of the brim is sloped off without any
particular regard to the quantity abstracted.</p>
<p>Walking-dresses are very much dotted just now with brown spots
of a mud colour, thrown on quite irregularly, and the heels of the
stockings may sometimes be seen trimmed with the same material. A
sort of basket-work is now a great deal seen as a head-dress, and
in these cases it is strewed over with little silver fish,
something like common sprat, which gives it a light and graceful
character.</p>

<h3>THE CHEROOT.</h3>
<p>An excellent thing it is, when you get it genuine&mdash;none of
your coarse Whitechapel abominations, but a veritable
satin-skinned, brown Indian beauty; smooth and firm to the touch,
and full-flavoured to the taste; such a one as would be worth a
Jewess&rsquo; eye, with a glass of tawny Port. But the
gratification that we have been wont to derive from our real
Manilla has been sadly disturbed of late by a circumstance which
has caused a dreadful schism in the smoking world, and has agitated
every divan in the metropolis to its very centre. The question is,
&ldquo;Whether should a cheroot be smoked by the great or the small
end?&rdquo; On this apparently trivial subject the great body of
cheroot smokers have taken different sides, and divided themselves,
as the Lilliputians did in the famous egg controversy, into the
<em>Big-endians</em> and <em>Little-endians</em>. The dispute has
been carried on with great vigour on both sides, and several
ingenious volumes have been already written, proving satisfactorily
the superiority of each system, without however convincing a single
individual of the opposite party. The Tories, we have observed,
have as usual seized on the <em>big end</em> of the argument, while
the Whigs have grappled as resolutely by the <em>little end</em>,
and are puffing away furiously in each other&rsquo;s eyes. Heaven
knows where the contest will end! For ourselves, we are content to
watch the struggle from our quiet corner, convinced, whichever end
gains the victory, that John Bull will be made to smoke for it; and
when curious people ask us if we be <em>big-endians</em> or
<em>little-endians</em>, we answer, that, to oblige all our
friends, we smoke our Manillas at <em>both ends</em>.</p>

<p><span class="hide">A</span>ll lovers are absurd and ridiculous.
The passion which spiritualises woman makes man a fool. Nothing can
be more amusing than to observe a bashful lover in company where
the object of his affections is present. He is the very picture of
confusion and distress, looking like a man who has lost something,
and knows not where to seek for it. His eyes wander from the carpet
to the ceiling; at one moment he is engaged in counting the panes
in the window, and the next in watching the discursive flights of a
blue-bottle round the apartment. But while he appears anxiously
seeking for some object on which to fix his attention, he carefully
avoids looking towards his <em>innamorata</em>; and should their
eyes meet by chance, his cheeks assume the tint of the beet-root or
the turnip, and his manifest embarrassment betrays his secret to
the most inexperienced persons. In order to recover his confidence,
he shifts his seat, which seems suddenly to have shot forth as many
pins as the back of a hedgehog; but in doing so he places the leg
of his chair on the toe of a gouty, cross old uncle, or on the tail
of a favourite lap-dog, and, besides creating an awful
<em>fracas</em>, succeeds in making inveterate enemies of the two
brutes for the remainder of their lives.</p>
<p>There are some lovers, who show their love by their affected
indifference, and appear smitten by any woman except the one whom
they are devoted to. This is an ingenious stratagem; but in general
it is so badly managed, that it is more easily seen through than a
cobweb. Lastly, there are a select few, who evince their tender
regard by perpetual bickerings and quarrels. This method will
frequently mislead inquisitive aunts and guardians; but it should
only be attempted by a man who has full confidence in his own
powers.</p>
<p>Lovers, as I have observed, are invariably objects of ridicule;
timid, jealous, and nervous, a frown throws them into a state of
agony it would be difficult to describe, and a smile bestowed upon
a rival breaks their rest for a week. Only observe one of them
engaged in a quiet, interesting
<em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em> with the lady of his
choice. He has exerted all his powers of fascination, and he
fancies he is beginning to make a favourable impression on his
companion, when&mdash;bang!&mdash;a tall, whiskered fellow, who,
rumour has whispered, is the lady&rsquo;s intended, drops in upon
them like a bomb-shell! The detected lover sits confounded and
abashed, wishing in the depths of his soul that he could transform
himself into a gnat, and make his exit through the keyhole.
Meantime the new-comer seats himself in solemn silence, and for
five minutes the conversation is only kept up by monosyllables, in
spite of the incredible efforts of all parties to appear
unconcerned. The young man in his confusion plunges deeper into the
mire;&mdash;he twists and writhes in secret agony&mdash;remarks on
the sultriness of the weather, though the thermometer is below the
freezing point; and commits a thousand
<em>gaucheries</em>&mdash;too happy if he can escape from a
situation than which nothing can possibly be conceived more
painful.</p>
<h4>THE LOVER AT DIFFERENT AGES.</h4>
<p>It would not be easy to determine at what age love first
manifests itself in the human heart; but if the reader have a good
memory (I now speak to my own sex), he may remember when its tender
light dawned upon his soul,&mdash;he may recall the moment when the
harmonious voice of woman first tingled in his ears, and filled his
bosom with unknown rapture,&mdash;he may recollect how he used to
forsake trap-ball and peg-top to follow the idol he had created in
her walks,&mdash;how he hoarded up the ripest oranges and gathered
the choicest flowers to present to her, and felt more than
recompensed by a word of thanks kindly spoken. Oh,
youth&mdash;youth! pure and happy age, when a smile, a look, a
touch of the hand, makes all sunshine and happiness in thy
breast.</p>
<p>But the season of boyhood passes&mdash;the youth of sixteen
becomes a young man of twenty, and smiles at the innocent emotions
of his uneducated heart. He is no longer the mute adorer who
worshipped in secrecy and in silence. Each season produces its own
flowers. At <span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name=
"page275"></a>[pg 275]</span>twenty, the time for mute sympathy has
passed away: it is one of the most eventful periods in the life of
a lover; for should he then chance to meet a heart free to respond
to his ardent passion, and that no cruel father, relentless
guardian, or richer lover interposes to overthrow his hopes, he may
with the aid of a licence, a parson, and a plain gold ring, be
suddenly launched into the calm felicity of married life.</p>
<p>I know not what mysterious chain unites the heart of a young
lover to that of the woman whom he loves. In the simplicity of
their hearts they often imagine it is but friendship that draws
them towards each other, until some unexpected circumstance removes
the veil from their eyes, and they discover the dangerous precipice
upon whose brink they have been walking. A journey, absence, or
sickness, inevitably produce a discovery. If a temporary separation
be about to occur, the unconscious lovers feel, they scarce know
wherefore, a deep shade of sadness steal over them; their adieux
are mingled with a thousand protestations of regret, which sink
into the heart and bear a rich harvest by the time they meet again.
Days and months glide by, and the pains of separation still endure;
for they feel how necessary they have become to the happiness of
each other, and how cold and joyless existence seems when far from
those we love.</p>
<p>That which may be anticipated, at length comes to pass; the
lover returns&mdash;he flies to his mistress&mdash;she receives him
with blushing cheek and palpitating heart. I shall not attempt to
describe the scene, but throughout the day and night that succeeds
that interview the lover seems like one distracted. In the city, in
the fields&mdash;alone, or in company&mdash;he hears nothing but
the magic words, &ldquo;I LOVE YOU!&rdquo; ringing in his ears, and
feels that ecstatic delight which it is permitted mortals to taste
but once in their lives.</p>
<p>But what are the sensations which enter the heart of a young and
innocent girl when she first confesses the passion that fills her
heart? A tender sadness pervades her being&mdash;her soul, touched
by the hand of Love, delivers itself to the influence of all the
nobler emotions of her nature; and borne heavenward on the
organ&rsquo;s solemn peal, pours forth its rich treasures in silent
and grateful adoration.</p>

"images/023-09.png" alt="A woman kneels on a prayer stool." id=
"img023-09" name="img023-09" width="70%" /></a></div>
<p>At thirty, a man takes a more decided&mdash;I wish I could add a
more amiable&mdash;character than at twenty. At twenty he loves
sincerely and devotedly; he respects the woman who has inspired him
with the noblest sentiment of which his soul is capable. At thirty
his heart, hardened by deceit and ill-requited affection, and
pre-occupied by projects of worldly ambition, regards love only as
an agreeable pastime, and woman&rsquo;s heart as a toy, which he
may fling aside the moment it ceases to amuse him. At twenty he is
ready to abandon everything for her whom he idolises&mdash;rank,
wealth, the future!&mdash;they weigh as nothing in the balance
against the fancied strength and constancy of his passion. At
thirty he coldly immolates the repose and happiness of the woman
who loves him to the slightest necessity. I must admit,
however&mdash;in justice to our sex&mdash;provided his love does
not interfere with his interest, nor his freedom, nor his club, nor
his dogs and horses, nor his <em>petites liaisons des
coulisses</em>, nor his hour of dinner&mdash;the lover is always
willing to make the greatest sacrifices for her whom he has
honoured with his regards. The man of thirty is, moreover, a man of
many loves; he carries on half-a-dozen affairs of the heart at the
same time&mdash;he has his writing-desk filled with
<em>billets-doux</em>, folded into a thousand fanciful shapes, and
smelling villanously of violets, roses, bergamot, and other
sentimental odours. He has a pocket-book full of little locks of
hair, of all colours, from the light golden to the raven black. In
short, the man of thirty is the most dangerous of lovers. Let my
fair readers watch his approaches with distrust, and place at every
avenue of their innocent hearts</p>

<p>An attenuated disciple of the ill-paid art which has been

small hanging match, in which he suicidically &ldquo;doubled&rdquo;
the character of criminal and Jack Ketch. Upon being asked by the
redoubtable Civic Peter what he meant by such conduct, he attempted
to urge the propriety of the proceeding according to the scholastic
rules of the ancients. &ldquo;It may,&rdquo; replied Sir Peter,

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h2>
<h3>THE UNITED SERVICE.</h3>
<p>The man who wishes to study an epitome of human
character&mdash;who wants to behold choice samples of &ldquo;all
sorts and conditions of men&rdquo;&mdash;to read out of a small, a
duodecimo edition of the great book of life&mdash;must take a
season&rsquo;s lodgings at a Cheltenham, a Harrowgate, or a
Brighton boarding-house. There he will find representatives of all
kinds of eccentricities,&mdash;members of every possible lodge of
&ldquo;odd fellows&rdquo; that Folly has admitted of her
crew&mdash;mixed up with everyday sort of people, sharpers,
schemers, adventurers, fortune-hunters, male and
female&mdash;widows, wags, and Irishmen. Hence, as the
&ldquo;proper study of mankind is man,&rdquo; a boarding-house is
the place to take lessons;&mdash;even on the score of economy, as
it is possible to live decently at one of these refuges for the
destitute for three guineas a-week, exclusive, however, of wine,
servants, flirtation, and other extras.</p>
<p>A result of this branch of study, and an example of such a mode
of studying it, is the farce with the above title, which has been
brought out at Covent Garden. <em>Mrs. Walker</em> (Mrs. Orger)
keeps a boarding-house, which also keeps her; for it is well
frequented: so well that we find her making a choice of inmates by
choosing to turn out <em>Mr. Woodpecker</em> (Mr. Walter
Lacy)&mdash;a mere &ldquo;sleeping-apartment&rdquo;
boarder&mdash;to make room for <em>Mrs. Coo</em> (Mrs. Glover), a
widow, whose demands entitle her to the dignity of a &ldquo;private
sitting and bedroom&rdquo; lodger. <em>Mr. Woodpecker</em> is very
comfortable, and does not want to go; but the hostess is obstinate:
he appeals to her feelings as an orphan, without home or
domesticity; but the lady, having been in business for a dozen
years, has lost all sympathy for orphans of six-and-twenty. In
short, <em>Mrs. Walker</em> determines he shall walk, and so shall
his luggage (a plethoric trunk and an obese carpet-bag are on the
stage); for she has dreamt even that has legs&mdash;such dreams
being, we suppose, very frequent to persons of her name.</p>
<p>You are not quite satisfied that the mere preference for a
better inmate furnishes the only reasons why the lady wants <em>Mr.
Woodpecker&rsquo;s room</em> rather than his company. Perhaps he is
in arrear; but no, he pays his bill: so it is not on <em>that</em>
score that he is so ruthlessly sent away. You are, however, not
kept long on the tiptoe of conjecture, but soon learn that <em>Mrs.
W.</em> has a niece, and you already know that the banished is
young, good-looking, and gay. Indeed, <em>Mrs. Walker</em> having
perambulated, <em>Miss Fanny Merrivale</em> (Miss Lee) appears, and
listens very composedly to the plan of an elopement from
<em>Woodpecker</em>, but speedily makes her <em>exit</em> to avoid
suspicion, and the enemy who has dislodged her lover; before whom
the latter also retreats, together with his bag and baggage.</p>
<p>There are no classes so well represented at boarding-houses as
those who sigh for fame, and those that are dying to be married.
Accordingly, we find in <em>Mrs. Walker&rsquo;s</em> establishment
<em>Captain Whistleborough</em> (Mr. W. Farren), who is doing the
extreme possible to get into Parliament, and <em>Captain Pacific,
R.N.</em>, (Mr. Bartley,) who is crowding all sail to the port of
matrimony. Well knowing how boarding-houses teem with such persons,
two men who come under the &ldquo;scheming&rdquo; category are also
inmates. One of these, <em>Mr. Enfield Bam</em> (Mr. Harley), is a
sort of parliamentary agent, who goes about to dig up aspirants
that are buried in obscurity, and to introduce them to boroughs, by
which means he makes a very good living. His present victim is, of
course, <em>Captain Whistleborough</em>, upon whom he is not slow
in commencing operations.</p>
<p><em>Captain Whistleborough</em> has almost every requisite for
an orator. He is an army officer; so his manners are good and his
self-possession complete. His voice is commanding, for it has been
long his duty to give the word of command. Above all, he has a
mania to become a member. Yet, alas! one trifling deficiency ruins
his prospects; he has an impediment in his speech, which debars him
from the use of the <em>W&rsquo;s</em>. Like the French alphabet,
that letter is denied to him. When he comes to a syllable it
begins, he is <em>spell</em>-bound; though he longs to go on, he
pulls up quite short, and sticks fast. The first <em>W</em> he
meets with in the flowery paths of rhetoric causes him to be as
dumb as an oyster, or as O. Smith in &ldquo;Frankenstein.&rdquo; In
vain does he try the Demosthenes&rsquo; plan by sucking pebbles on
the Brighton shore and haranguing the <em>w</em>aves, though he is
unable to address them by name. All is useless, and he has resigned
himself to despair and a Brighton boarding-house, when <em>Mr.
Enfield Bam</em> gives him fresh hopes. He informs him that the
proprietress of a pocket borough resides under the same roof, and
that he will (for the usual consideration) get the Captain such an
introduction to her as shall ensure him a seat in her good graces,
and another in St. Stephen&rsquo;s. <em>Mr. Bam</em>, therefore,
goes off to negotiate with <em>Miss Polecon</em> (Mrs. Tayleure),
and makes way for the intrigues of another sort of an agent, who
lives in the house.</p>
<p>This is <em>Rivet</em> (Mr. C. Mathews), a gentleman who
undertakes to procure for an employer anything upon earth he may
want, at so much per cent. commission. There is nothing that this
very general agent cannot get hold of, from a hack to a
husband&mdash;from a boat to a baronetcy&mdash;from a
tortoise-shell tom-cat to a rich wife. Matrimonial agency is,
however, his passion, and he has plenty of indulgence for it in a
Brighton boarding-house. <em>Captain Pacific</em> wants a wife,
<em>Mrs. Coo</em> is a widow, and all widows want husbands. Thus
<em>Rivet</em> makes sure of a swingeing commission from both
parties; for, in imagination, and in his own memorandum-book, he
has already married them.</p>
<p>Here are the ingredients of the farce; and in the course of it
they are compounded in such wise as to make <em>Woodpecker</em>
jealous, merely because he happens to find <em>Fanny</em> in the
dark, and in <em>Whistleborough&rsquo;s</em> arms; to cause the
latter to negotiate with <em>Mrs. Coo</em> for a seat in
Parliament, instead of a wedding-ring; and <em>Pacific</em> to talk
of the probable prospects of the nuptial state to <em>Miss
Polecon</em>, who is an inveterate spinster and a political
economist, professing the Malthusian creed. <em>Rivet</em> finding
<em>Fanny</em> and her friend are taking business out of his hands
by planning an elopement <em>en amateur</em>, gets himself
&ldquo;regularly called in,&rdquo; and manages to save
<em>Woodpecker</em> all the trouble, by contriving that
<em>Whistleborough</em> shall run away with the young lady by
mistake, so that <em>Woodpecker</em> might marry her, and no
mistake. <em>Bam</em> bams <em>Whistleborough</em>, who ends the
piece by threatening his deceiver with an action for breach of
promise of borough, all the other breaches having been duly made
up; together with the match between <em>Mrs. Coo</em> and
<em>Pacific</em>.</p>
<p>If our readers want to be told what we think of this farce, they
will be disappointed; if they wish to know whether it is good or
bad, witty or dull, lively or stupid&mdash;whether it ought to have
been damned outright, or to supersede the Christmas
pantomime&mdash;whether the actors played well or played the
deuce&mdash;whether the scenery is splendid and the appointments
appropriate or otherwise, they must judge for themselves by going
to see it; because if we gave them our opinion they would not
believe us, seeing that the author is one of our most esteemed
(especially over a boiled chicken and sherry), most merry, most
jolly, most clever colleagues; one, in fine, of PUNCH&rsquo;S
&ldquo;United Service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been running ever since I was born and am not

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
